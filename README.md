Tasks Completed
Here's a breakdown of the four data science tasks in this repository:

Task 1: Iris Dataset Analysis & Visualization

Problem: Predict Iris species from physical characteristics.

Goal: Explore, visualize, and understand the dataset for classification.

Outcome: Demonstrated foundational data handling and pattern discovery.

Notebook: iris_dataset_analysis.ipynb

Task 2: Stock Price Prediction (Short-Term with Linear Regression)

Problem: Predict next day's AAPL closing price using historical data.

Goal: Build and evaluate a Linear Regression model for stock forecasting.

Outcome: Implemented time-series prediction, evaluated with R² and RMSE.

Notebook: aapl_stock_prediction.ipynb

Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction (Logistic Regression)

Problem: Predict heart disease risk from medical attributes.

Goal: Classify patients using Logistic Regression.

Outcome: Handled preprocessing, built a classification model, and evaluated using various metrics.

Notebook: heart_disease_prediction.ipynb

Task 4: House Price Prediction (Linear & Gradient Boosting Regression)

Problem: Predict house prices based on property features.

Goal: Preprocess data, train Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting models, and evaluate performance.

Outcome: Performed preprocessing and compared two regression models.
