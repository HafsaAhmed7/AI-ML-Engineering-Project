# AI-ML-Engineering-Project
My Data Science Projects (Google Colab)
This repository showcases data science projects completed in Google Colaboratory. Each notebook demonstrates my skills in data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning using Python.

# 🌸 Task 1: Iris Dataset Analysis

### 🧠 Objective
Explore the Iris dataset and understand feature relationships for flower species classification.

### 📂 Dataset
Seaborn’s built-in Iris dataset (150 samples, 3 species, 4 features).

### 🛠️ Methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization using pairplots, histograms, boxplots

### ✅ Findings
- Petal features are most important for species separation.
- Setosa is clearly distinguishable; others overlap slightly.
# 📈 Task 2: Stock Price Prediction

### 🧠 Objective
Predict next-day closing prices for AAPL stock using historical data.

### 📂 Dataset
Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock data retrieved via `yfinance`.

### 🛠️ Methods
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Linear Regression model
- Evaluation using R² Score and RMSE

### ✅ Findings
- Model captured short-term trends moderately well.
- Visualization showed prediction alignment with actual prices.
# ❤️ Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction

### 🧠 Objective
Classify whether a person has heart disease based on health attributes.

### 📂 Dataset
-Heart Disease Prediction Dataset (structured medical data from Kaggle).
-The dataset (`HeartDiseaseTrain-Test.csv`) is included in this folder for easy access and reproducibility. You can click on it to view or download the raw data used in this task.
### 🛠️ Methods
- Logistic Regression model
- Evaluation via accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve

### ✅ Findings
- Achieved strong classification performance.
- Features like cholesterol and chest pain type were significant.
# 🏠 Task 4: House Price Prediction

### 🧠 Objective
Predict house prices using property features like area, bedrooms, and location.

### 📂 Dataset
-House Price Prediction Dataset (from Kaggle).
-The dataset (`House Price Prediction Dataset.csv`) is included in this folder for easy access and reproducibility. You can click on it to view or download the raw data used in this task.


### 🛠️ Methods
- Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Evaluation with MAE and RMSE

### ✅ Findings
- Gradient Boosting outperformed linear regression.
- Models predicted prices close to actual values on test data.
